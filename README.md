Main Purprose of this project is to demonstrate how a CPU handles
processes based on different algorithms, 4 to be precise. The 4 algorithms
are FCFS(First Come First Serve, Pre Emptive, Round Robin and Shortest Remaing Time).
The theory behind all these is on the other markdown file so if you have any questions
refer to that.
